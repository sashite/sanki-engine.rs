//! Golden vectors: the "All capture cases" tables from the three interaction docs.
//!
//! This file's single responsibility: to validate the **capture transformation**
//! end-to-end — not the pure EPIN function (already covered by `crate::capture`'s
//! unit tests), but its observable effect during a real capture played by the
//! kernel. Each case plays a capturing move via [`step`] and checks the
//! **resulting FEEN**, in particular the "hands" field: the captured piece must
//! enter it in its transformed canonical form.
//!
//! The cases mirror, one by one, the rows of the "All capture cases" tables of
//! `interactions-chess-ogi.md`, `interactions-ogi-xiongqi.md` and
//! `interactions-chess-xiongqi.md`, rounded out by the three pure-variant
//! captures. The rule in brief:
//!
//! - a **chess** or **xiongqi** capturer preserves the identity (type and side)
//!   of the taken piece — only the `+`/`-` markers drop and the ōgi Tokin is
//!   demoted to a Fu; the resulting hand is *inert* (wrong case);
//! - an **ōgi** capturer converts any non-ōgi piece into a **Fu of its own side**
//!   (droppable), and flips the side of an ōgi piece.
//!
//! Common setup: the capturer's Rook/Chariot (first player) is on `a1`, the
//! captured piece (second player) on `a5`; the move is always the capture
//! `a1 x a5`. The opposing king is placed on `h8` — not on the `e`-file — to avoid
//! a **xiongqi General**, which attacks like a Chariot, putting the capturer's
//! king in check along the shared file (which would make the capture illegal).
//! This file is **self-contained**.
